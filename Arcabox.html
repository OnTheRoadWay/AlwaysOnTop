</header>

<section>
    <h2>1. Scope of Application</h2>
    <p>This privacy policy applies to the use of Arcabox, which requires permissions to access certain device features, including the microphone, photo library, and camera. These permissions are requested to enable the following functionalities:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Microphone</strong>: To measure the current decibel levels, allowing users to monitor sound intensity.</li>
        <li><strong>Photo Library</strong>: To read QR codes stored in the photo album, enabling quick access to information encoded in images.</li>
        <li><strong>Camera</strong>: To scan QR codes directly and to facilitate image cropping using a grid layout for ease of use in various scenarios.</li>
    </ul>
</section>

<section>
    <h2>2. Information Usage</h2>
    <p>The information collected through these permissions is strictly used for the intended functionalities:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Microphone Data</strong>: Used to provide real-time decibel readings; no audio data is stored or transmitted.</li>
        <li><strong>Photo Library Access</strong>: Utilized only to scan QR codes; Arcabox does not access or store other personal photos.</li>
        <li><strong>Camera Data</strong>: Used for QR code scanning and image cropping; no video or photo data is stored beyond the session unless explicitly saved by the user.</li>
